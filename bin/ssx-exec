# Bash wrapper for OpenSSH CLI tools (ssh, scp, sftp, or any that accept
# the `-i /path/to/keyfile` option) that allows for passing an SSH private
# key as the first parameter rather than via a persistent identity file.
# This is something that is not possible with ssh tools by default.
#
# This command is useful when storing the key in an environment variable
# that is set in some secure way, such as set via secrets mastered in the
# AWS Parameter Store, or as the result another command in a subshell.
#
# The "OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY" lines at the beginning and end of the passed
# key string will be added if they are not on already present.
#
# Usage: with-ssh-key {ssh | scp | sftp} KEY ADDITIONAL_ARGS...
#
# Examples:
#   key="b3blbnnzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAA[etc...]"
#   with-ssh-key "$key" ssh myserver echo Hello-from-myserver
#   with-ssh-key "$key" scp myserver:file.txt ./
#   echo get file.txt | with-ssh-key "$key" sftp myserver
#
# A note regarding zsh: this wrapper is not necessary in zsh because zsh
# has the extremely convenient `=(cmd)` syntax which will create a real
# on-disk tempfile and clean it up immediately after the calling command
# exits. Thus you can easily do something like this in zsh to accomplish
# the same effect as this wrapper:
#
#   ssh -i =(echo "$key") ...
#
# Or, if you need to add the header/footer lines:
#
#   ssh -i =(echo "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n$(echo "$key")\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----")
